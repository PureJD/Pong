# Pong
#### This is a version of pong created in Python, using the turtle graphics library. The program utilises object-oriented programming in which classes are created and used but also hierarchy is used to inherit class attributes.

#### - The code performs the following steps:
- The paddles are drawn to the screen using new objects which utilise the Turtle Superclass 
- The ball is drawn to the screen using new objects which utilise the Turtle Superclass 
- The score is drawn to the screen using new objects which utilise the Turtle Superclass 
- The score is kept throughout the session
- The ball is then moved across the screen and collisions are managed with if statements

#### Future considerations for this project include recreating the project utilising the Python pygame library which will allow higher performance. Also, an implementation of game AI which controls l_paddle would be a good addition.
